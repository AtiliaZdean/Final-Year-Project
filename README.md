## 📌 Project Overview  
**HygieiaHub** is a lightweight, database-driven web application designed to streamline cleaning service bookings for single-provider operations. It addresses inefficiencies in manual scheduling, service transparency, and performance tracking by offering a structured, role-specific digital solution. Developed using PHP and MySQL within the XAMPP environment, the system follows the Waterfall methodology to ensure systematic development from requirement analysis to deployment.

   - Predefined service packages, time slots, and house types  
   - Minimized booking conflicts and improved customer convenience  

2. **Real-Time Service Tracking**  
   - Live booking status updates for customers  
   - Appointment and resource management for staff  

3. **Reporting & Analytics Integration**  
   - Operational insights: peak times, service demand, customer preferences  
   - Data-driven decision-making support  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
